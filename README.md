# 🧬 Cancer Genomics: Open-Source Bioinformatics Research

Welcome to a **Cancer Genomics Open-Source Research Project**, where we're analyzing real cancer mutation data using bioinformatics tools and statistical methods. 

## 🚀 What This Project Does
✅ Uses **100% Open-Source/Open-Access Genomic Data**  
✅ Investigates **mutations & gene expression changes in cancer**  
✅ Applies **Bioinformatics + Python-based data analysis**  
✅ Documents every step **as a reproducible research workflow**  
✅ Provides **detailed tutorials for learning bioinformatics**  

## 🔬 Current Research Focus
1️⃣ **Downloading & analyzing ICGC/PCAWG mutation data**  
2️⃣ **Comparing cancer vs. healthy genome mutations**  
3️⃣ **Visualizing mutations & gene expression patterns**  
4️⃣ **Publishing findings as an open research paper**  

## 📂 How to Use This Repository
